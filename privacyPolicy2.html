<p>Conjugar uses the Amazon Web Services&trade; analytics product, Pinpoint&trade;, to track certain information. This information consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each screen visited</li>

<li>The act of starting a quiz</li>

<li>The act of finishing a quiz, with score</li>

<li>Game Center&trade; authentication</li>

<li>App version</li>

<li>Unique installs</li>

<li>Device type (iPhone or iPad)</li>

<li>Country of user</li>
</ul>

<p>Conjugar does <em>not</em> track any personally identifiable user information.</p>

<p>As demonstrated in the following examples, analytics inform future development of Conjugar.</p>

<p>At present, quizzes have fifty verbs. The goal of this length is to present a mix of all tenses for the current difficulty level with a mix of regular and irregular verbs. But if, for example, most users are starting but not finishing quizzes, Conjugar's developer might consider shortening the quiz length.</p>

<p>Conjugar has Game Center&trade; integration. Use of this integration is optional. If most users are not authenticating Game Center&trade;, Conjugar's developer might consider removing the integration.</p>

<p>Please direct any questions about or feedback on this privacy policy to Conjugar's <a href="mailto:vermontcoder@gmail.com">developer</a>.</p>
